# My_AHK_Script
To run make sure to install nircmd in system 32, and Autohotkey
It's being weird so run it with the script in atom in background

	Autohotkey: https://autohotkey.com/
	Autohotkey is really simple to install so just follow the prompts and stuff

	Nircmd: http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html
	Nircmd gives really weird (to me) instructions for how to install so:
	Extract .zip file with winrar to system 32 (C:\Windows\System32)

And that's about it just run this script with both of the above installed


So far the commands in this autokey/nircmd script are:

	Ctrl+Shift+Scroll up/down: clipboard history

With numlock OFF

	NumpadDot: Open google chrome

	Numpad0: Pause/play

	Numpad1: Media Last

	Numpad2: Media next

	Numpad3: Open Control panel

	Numpad4: Mute volume

	Numpad5: Un-mute volume

	Numpad6: Open Notepad

	Numpad7: Inserts Email1

	Numpad8: Inserts Email2

	Numpad9: Run Overwatch (Best Game Ever)
